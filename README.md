# Enterprise Systems Assessment - Media Library Management System

This project is part of the Enterprise Systems Assessment for the subject, and aims to develop a .NET-based application for managing a media library in AIT Ultimo campus. The system will enable the librarian and students to manage and search for DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, borrow and return media, and maintain their profile information.

## Part 1 - Prototype:
The first part of the project requires you to develop a prototype of the solution that demonstrates your ability to provide object-oriented design using .NET technology. The prototype must include a login screen, media search (minimum of 2 criteria), and media browsing functionality.

## Part 2 - Programming .NET:
The second part of the project requires you to create a full-function .NET application to solve the case study. The application should include login, media browse, media search (at least 3 criteria including Title search), media borrow, media reserve, media return, master information maintenance (Add new, Update, Delete), user information maintenance (Add new, Update, Delete), and reporting (at least 1 report).

## Part 3 - Cloud Application:
The third part of the project requires you to create a web service to replace the local connection between the Win-based User Interface (UI) and Business Logic function that you implemented in Part 2. This part has two components - Part 3.1 and Part 3.2.

### Part 3.1 - Convert direct accesses to web services:
In this part, you need to develop a web service project using Visual Web Developer, and a Win-based UI project using Visual C#. You should replace the direct accesses to business logic with web services.

### Part 3.2 - Win-Based applications:
In this part, you need to ensure that all functions required from Part 2 are working after changing the direct reference to Business Logic to Web Services. You should also implement static values as constant or enumeration.

## Implementation Guidelines:
The sample implementation should contain a user interface (Win-based application) for login, master information modify function (Media, Director, Categories etc.), media borrow/return function, query page with results (reporting for librarian/manager), and a logout button. The business logic and data access should be implemented separately. The web service should consist of web services, business logic, and data access projects with query management (Select, Insert, Update, and Delete).

To run the application, you should have Microsoft Visual Studio installed on your system and MySql databse to connect. Clone or download the project, and open the solution file in Visual Studio. Build and run the application.
